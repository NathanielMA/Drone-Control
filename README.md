## Welcome to Our Senior Design Project
## SOFWERX Drone Control

Our project utilizes the ESP8266 12E to receive data from 5 flex sensors, Voice Recognition module, MPU-6050 IMU and a 0.96" OLED. The ESP8266 is able to communicate with our drone utilizes its' built-in WiFi module. By using the WiFiUdp library for the ESP8266 12E we are able to send UDP packets to and from the Drone!
